Irc client for acme

mk install

Irc [-f fullname] [-n nick] [-s servername] [-p passwd] server
  
  You'll get a window named /irc/servername and it will try to log in.
  You can specify multiple -n options to try multiple nicks until a good
  one is found.  If you specify -p, the password is sent to nickserv in
  an identify message.
  
  Once the login is done, the tag of /irc/servname will have List Chat
  in it.  Executing List will list all the channels.  Executing List #foo
  will list just channel #foo.
  
  Executing Chat #foo joins channel foo and creates a new window
  /irc/servername/#foo.  Text typed at the end of the window is sent to foo.
  Clicking Del leaves the channel.
  
  Executing Chat user opens a window /irc/servername/user for chatting
  with user.  The behavior is the same as Chat #foo.  User chat windows
  are opened automatically on incoming messages.
  
  Executing Whois user runs whois on the user, displaying the results in
  /irc/servername and optionally in /irc/user, if that window exists.

ircmux [-r] [-f fullname] [-a addr] [-j join]... [-l logdir] [-n nick]... [-p passwd] server

  Ircmux is an irc multiplexor that allows multiple connections to
  masquerade as a single one.  It dials the server and logs in just like
  Irc, joins the given channels, and then announces on addr.  (If the -a
  option is omitted, it does not announce at all.)  Connections on addr can
  pretend to log in, but in reality they all appear as the one connection.
  
  The -l option specifies a logging directory.  If it is given, then all IRC
  messages are logged in that directory in files named by their channels,
  e.g., #plan9.
